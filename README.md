You want to demonstrate how effectively you can apply the techniques we have learned in this second unit (Weeks 11-
17). So, show me how you can use the techniques that we have learned during this time.
DO NOT use any online code generator, artificial intelligence, or any other outside assistance to create your scripts. If I
suspect that you may have used unauthorized means to write your work, I will ask you to meet with me and explain
how you created your code.
You can refer to general online resources for assistance with MATLAB commands and techniques. If applicable, include
a reference in your comments to show me where you found a new technique.
